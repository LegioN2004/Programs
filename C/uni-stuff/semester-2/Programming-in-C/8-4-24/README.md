# Pattern questions

## how to approach pattern questions

Follow the steps below to go through every sort of pattern questions

1. Run the outer for loop the number of times you are having the lines. In every pattern question, we'll get rows and columns just like matrices, so the outer for loop will run for the no of rows and the inner one will run for columns. example: In the first row there is 4 rows and 4 columns. 1st row has 1 cols, 2nd row has 2 cols, 3rd row has 3 cols and 4th row has 4 cols. So the no of lines = no of rows = no of times the outer loop will run

```
    *
    **
    ***
    ****
```

2. Step two is to figure out how many columns are there in each row, basically identify for every row number how many columns are there or types of elements in the columns. In the above example, the row number is equal to the number of columns.
3. What do you need to print
