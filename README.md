## TODO [ ] JAVA dir

- the java directory contains the java programs that I have written.
- I am documenting my notes, assignments and the follow up code of the videos whilst learning the JAVA programming language and DSA concepts taught in YouTube by Kunal Kushwaha in this playlist [Java + DSA + Interview Preparation Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ) (links may change)
  so go to this [directory](https://github.com/LegioN2004/Programs/tree/main/JAVA/kunal-java-dsa) to see the notes and other stuff

## TODO [ ] C++ dir

- It contains a lot of the cpp files that i have done throughout my 11th and 12th standard.
- It has a lot of stuff from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) (#THE GOAT#), various websites such as [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) and also from the playlis of some youtube channels such as [CodeWithHarry-cpp](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agpFUAlPFe_VNSlXW5uE0YL), [apnacollege](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe0b2nM6JHVCnAkhQRGiZMSJ)(too pro)

- [ ] still a lot of stuff left to learn, main concepts.

## TODO [ ] learning documentation

### the markdown, norg and org dirs

- These are some documentation formats.
- I have a lot of things to learn here such as markdown/org mode for documenting stuff for git repo readmes, documentation, wiki, etc.
- [ ] learning Markdown for documentation in GitHub or GitLab repos, has a very good support. Not much to do btw.
- Also org mode maybe has bad support in those two above sites, so confused between the two.
  - Org is too good to compare to md, Org has almost everything.
  - I use doom emacs for better org mode documentation [Doomemacs](https://www.github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)
- This neorg is the meta neovim version of org with better support, still evolving, planning to use as i am a full time neovim user  and it looks promising but doesn't support in git hosting sites, better for self notes, time table etc stuff. Wanna contribute or have a look, go to [nvim-neorg/neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg)

## (IGNORE) GO and Rust dir

some random stuff gui done using chatgpt(lol), and some projects probably will need to learn in the future.

## Extras and testing folder

some random testing files such as benchmarking (more like stressing) cpu using matrixstress.py, some whatsapp spam bot, autoclicker bot, keyboard-layout-analyzer, johntheripper(those who know knows this thing). Highly buggy stuff, some are copied, some are made by "knowledge" stuff shared in websites.
