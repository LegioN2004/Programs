# About this REPO

## About the directories

**The directory structure is according to the languages and stuff that I have done for all the past years up till present so feel free to look around**

### JAVA

- The `java` directory contains the all the java programs that I have written.
- I am documenting my notes, assignments and the follow up code of the videos whilst learning the JAVA programming language and DSA concepts taught in YouTube by Kunal Kushwaha in this playlist named [Java + DSA + Interview Preparation Course](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL9gnSGHSqcnr_DxHsP7AW9ftq0AtAyYqJ) (links may change)
  so go to this [directory](https://github.com/LegioN2004/Programs/tree/main/JAVA/kunal-java-dsa) to see the notes and other stuff
- I have used the an IDE to do this stuff, so you may see some config files and dir files here and there, I have a .gitignore to not track those but ignore if there is still some leftout.
- [ ] todo leetcode problems

### C++

- The `C++/CPP` directory contains a lot of the cpp files that i have done throughout my 11th and 12th standard.
- It has a lot of stuff from [freecodecamp.org](https://www.freecodecamp.org) (#THE GOAT#), various websites such as [learncpp.com](https://www.learncpp.com) and also from the playlis of some youtube channels such as [CodeWithHarry-cpp](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agpFUAlPFe_VNSlXW5uE0YL), [apnacollege](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfqMhTWNBTe0b2nM6JHVCnAkhQRGiZMSJ)(too pro)
  it also has some [Hackerrank-cpp](https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/cpp)
- still a lot of stuff left to learn, main concepts.
- [ ] todo: leetcode problems

### Documentation stuff, markdown, norg and org dirs

- These are some documentation language that I have tried, nothing special just tried out their syntax and other language specific stuff.
- WHY: for documenting stuff in git repo readmes, actual documentation, wiki, etc and so I am storing those here in their respective directories'.
- [ ] todo: Learn Markdown, since they have a very good support. Not much to do btw.
- Also org mode maybe has bad support in those two above sites, so I am confused what to use between the two.
  - Org is wayy superior to markdown and too good to compare to md, Org has almost everything but it's support in the version control hosting websites is not present or destitute .
  - I use doom emacs or more appropiately emacs for better org mode documentation since it is the only editor that fully supports org mode which includes all its features like org agenda,(idk much more but apparently it helps you to set your whole planning, dates, schedule, timetable) [Doomemacs](https://www.github.com/doomemacs/doomemacs)
- This neorg is the meta neovim version of org with better support, still evolving, planning to use as i am a full time neovim user and it looks promising but doesn't support version control hosting sites, better for self notes, time table etc stuff. Wanna contribute or have a look, go to [nvim-neorg/neorg](https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg)

### WebDev dir

- Contains some WebDev stuff from [freeCodeCamp](freecodecamp.org)
  - [Responsive-web-design](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/2022/responsive-web-design/) done [2/20]
  - [scrimba courses free](hhttps://scrimba.com/allcourses?price=free)
- WebDev tutorial from CodeWithHarry : [WebDev tutorial for beginners in Hindi: HTML, CSS and JavaScript](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLu0W_9lII9agiCUZYRsvtGTXdxkzPyItg). \*ongoing.
  - my notes and code is here [notes+code](https://github.com/LegioN2004/Programs/tree/main/WebDev-stuff/codewithharryWebDev/codewithharryHTML%2CCSS%26JS)
- I also did some from the foundation of [TheOdinProject](https://www.theodinproject.com/paths/foundations/courses/foundations)
- Started Harkirat's Cohort 0-1, hopefully I can start the 1-100 once I become able enough.
- more incoming

## GO and Rust dir

some random stuff in gui done using rust with help from chatgippity and some projects probably will need to learn in the future. IGNORE

## Extras and testing folder

some random testing files such as benchmarking (more like stressing) cpu using matrixstress.py, some whatsapp spam bot, autoclicker bot, keyboard-layout-analyzer, johntheripper(those who know knows what this thing is). Highly buggy stuff, some are copied, some are made by "knowledge" stuff shared in websites.
