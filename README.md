- still a lot of stuff left to learn.
- The C part contains mostly my college stuff that I have organized according to what was taught, what topics, what concepts, in which day, etc and nothing much. I have plans to do some low level projects in C just to learn more about the working of the stuff under the hood.

## Misc stuff

- Extras and testing folder
  - some random testing files such as cpu stressing using matrixstress.py, some whatsapp spam bot, autoclicker bot, keyboard-layout-analyzer, johntheripper(iykyk what this thing is). Highly buggy stuff, some are copied, some are made by "knowledge" stuff shared in websites.
- Documentation stuff using neorg, org mode, markdown
  - These are some documentation languages that I have used here and there to document stuff.
  - WHY: for documenting stuff in git repo readmes, actual documentation, wiki, etc and so I am storing those here in their respective directories'.
- GO, RUST, Zig, Dart dir
  - Just messing around with these new flashy languages, I just like to code too much. IGNORE
