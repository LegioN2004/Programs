// word vs keyword

// 'for', 'else', 'if, etc are keywords so it can't be used as we wish but other words such as names, etc can be done so

// to store any type of data we use variables

var hello = 10;
console.log(hello + hello);

// this is known as hoisting
console.log(a);
var a = 12;

var b = [1, 2, 3, 4];
var c = b;
b.pop();
console.log(c);
