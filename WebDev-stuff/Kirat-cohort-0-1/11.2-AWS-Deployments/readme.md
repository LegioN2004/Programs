# Step 1 - What is AWS

AWS is Amazon’s `cloud` service. Earlier datacenters were a thing that big companies had in order to store their data but cloud services weren't. We didn't have those websites where we can click a button and that provided us with the same services where we can rent servers, store our data and another company handles all other things for you.

It let’s you

1. Rent servers
2. Manage domains
3. Upload objects (mp4 files, jpgs, mp3s, ....... in something called S3 object store)
4. Autoscale servers
5. Create k8s clusters

The offering we will be focussing on today is `Renting servers`

# Step 2 - EC2 servers

VMs on AWS are called `EC2 Servers`. This was the biggest offering by AWS.

EC2 stands for Elastic compute Version 2.

1. `Elastic` - Can increase/decrease the size of the machine
2. `Compute` - It is a machine
3. `2` - It is the second version of the machine

**Compute** is a fancy word for a machine that can run code.

You can spin up a new EC2 instance from the aws dashboard. EC2 instances are virtual machines that run on AWS infrastructure. You can choose the size of the instance, the operating system, and the software that runs on the instance.
