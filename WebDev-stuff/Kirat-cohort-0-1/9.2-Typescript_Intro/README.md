# Typescript (still the devs' nightmare)

## Types of languages

- Strongly typed vs loosely typed
The terms strongly typed and loosely typed refer to how programming languages handle types, particularly how strict they are about type conversions and type safety.

| Strongly typed languages | Loosely typed languages |
| ------- | ------- |
| Examples - Java, C++, C, Rust | Examples - Python, Javascript, Perl, php |
| Benefits - | Benefits - |
| Lesser runtime errors | Easy to write code |
| Stricter codebase | Fast to bootstrap |
| Easy to catch errors at compile time | Low learning curve |

- Code doesn‚Äôt work ‚ùå

```cpp
#include <iostream>

int main() {
int number = 10;
number = "text";
return 0;
}
```

- Code does work ‚úÖ

```js
function main() {
let number = 10;
number = "text";
return number;
}
```

> People realised that javascript is a very power language, but lacks types. Typescript was introduced as a new language to add types on top of javascript.

## What is Typescript

- What is typescript?
  - TypeScript is a programming language developed and maintained by Microsoft.
  - It is a strict syntactical superset of JavaScript and adds optional static typing to the language.
  - It is backwards compatible with JS

- Where/How does typescript code run?
  - Typescript code never runs in your browser. Your browser can only understand javascript.
  - Javascript is the runtime language (the thing that actually runs in your browser/nodejs runtime)
  - Typescript is something that compiles down to javascript, more appropriately 'transpiled' down to JS
  - When typescript is compiled down to javascript, you get type checking (similar to C++). If there is an error, the conversion to Javascript fails.

- Typescript compiler
  - `tsc` is the official typescript compiler that you can use to convert Typescript code into Javascript
  - There are many other famous compilers/transpilers for converting Typescript to Javascript. Some famous ones are -
    - `esbuild`
    - `swc`

## Creating a typescript node project

 The tsc compiler
We can bootstrap a simple Typescript Node.js application locally on our machines by the following steps:

- Step 1 - Install tsc/typescript globally
` npm install -g typescript `
- Step 2 - Initialize an empty Node.js project with typescript

```bash
mkdir node-app
cd node-app
npm init -y
npx tsc --init
```

These commands should initialize two files in your project

- Step 3 - Create a a.ts file
` npm install -g typescript `

```ts
const x: number = 1;
console.log(x);
```

- Step 4 - Compile the ts file to js file
` tsc -b `
- Step 5 - Explore the newly generated index.js file
Notice how there is no typescript code in the javascript file. It‚Äôs a plain old js file with no types
- Step 6 - Try assigning x to a string
Make sure you convert the const to let

```ts
let x: number = 1;
x = "harkirat"
console.log(x);
```

- Step 7 - Delete a.js
- Step 8 - Try compiling the code again
` tsc -b `
Notice all the errors you see in the console. This tells you there are type errors in your codebase.
Also notice that no index.js is created anymore

This is the high level benefit of typescript. It lets you catch type errors at compile time

- About the tsconfig.json
  - This file contains a bunch of variables we can call them configurations, which we can turn true or false and based on that the compilation process will change.
  - There are a lot of configurations within the file which we don't need to learn all of them, but some popular ones should be learned
- About package.json
  - It has nothing to do with typescript
  - It just contains the packages, their versions and some other stuff regarding the package management

- rule of thumb: You don't need to look the generated js file from the TS compiler tsc, since we are writing a very few lines of code so it is readable but once we write very complex stuff, it gets super ugly because it is generated by the compiler, just like the index.html generated when we build the react project files using vite.

## Basic Types in TypeScript

- Typescript provides us with some basic types such as `number`, `string`, `boolean`, `null`, `undefined`.
Let‚Äôs create some simple applications using these types -

- Problem 1 - Hello world

  > üí° Thing to learn - How to give types to arguments of a function

  - Write a function that greets a user given their first name.
    Argument - firstName
    Logs - Hello {firstName}
    Doesn‚Äôt return anything
  Solution: Here we can see that everything is the same as JS, but the thing that is different is the argument which requires a type since it is TS and it has types for most of the things so as to reduce errors

```js
function greet(name: string) {
 console.log('heloooo', name);
}
greet('byeeeeeeeee');
```

- Problem 2 - Sum function

  > üí° Thing to learn - How to assign a return type to a function

  - Write a function that calculates the sum of two functions
  Solution: 

  ```js

  ```

- Problem 3 - Return true or false based on if a user is 18+

> üí° Thing to learn - Type inference
Function name - isLegal
Code

Problem 4 -
Create a function that takes another function as input, and runs it after 1 second.
