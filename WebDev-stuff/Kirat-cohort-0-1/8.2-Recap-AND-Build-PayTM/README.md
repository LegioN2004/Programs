## express routing

- how to do it:
  - First make a new routes folder and then make a file there with the name index.js and then setup the router there

```js
const router = express.Router();
module.exports = router;
```

- Then import the router in index.js and route all requests from /api/v1 to the router in the routes folder, by using
  the `app.use` and the required router inside it. This router will handle all the requests coming there. By giving the
  route and then the place where to route separated with commas, we'll make all the requests route to the mainRouter
  path i.e the index file in the routes folder

```js
const mainRouter = require("./routes/index");
app.use('/api/v1', mainRouter)
```

- Why are we doing this, so as to maintain structure in our backend such that we can route users coming to our site
  using this route, where the old ones gets to v1 and the new ones go to v2 and so on. We can better structure our
  backend using this express router. That's what express does when we pass in two arguments, one for the route path and
  the second is the middleware/actual logic that will happen for the routerPath.

- our requests will eventually look
  like `/api/v1/user`, `/api/v1/user/signup`, `/api/v1/user/signin`, `/api/v1/user/signin` or our requests will be like
  this `/api/v1/account/transferMoney`, `/api/v1/account/balance`.
  - now we can do the above by adding the user and account routes to the main index file itself or we can do something
   like using the main index file as our center file which routes the v1/v2/v3... requests to the routes index file
   of our backend and the we can use different file for the user requests and account requests respectively.
  - So we can structure a chunk of our api's to a single file and another chunk to another file all through routing it
   through the main index file

  ```js
  // backend's main index.js file
  const mainRouter = require("./routes/index");
  app.use('/api/v1', mainRouter); // uses /api/v1 endpoint to the mainRouter which is the route's main index file

  // route's main index.js file
  const userRouter = require("./user");
  router.use('/user', userRouter); // routes all the /user endpoint to the userRouter which is the route's user router file

  // and then the above line routes the user requests for various user specific things like signup signin to the router's user file, as we have done before all in the main file itself
  router.get('/signup', (req,res) => {
      console.log("signup router");
  });
  ```

- Then setup some routes and in that we have used the user route which routes all the user requests and it has the
  middlewares imported that will handle all the authentication, signin, signup, update, delete and will have all of
  their logic

- The zod object returns a success object which we can destructure and use it directly or we can take the object in a
  variable and use the `.` to get the success object which returns true or false based on the parsing of the output.

- why are we using Bearer in token: For security reasons we should make sure that the Authorization header has the
  expected content. We simply should not accept a header that does not start with Bearer if we are expecting it ("
  Bearer" is a recommendation in the RFC, it is not mandatory) ".
  - Ideally what we should do this authentication is by sending out an otp to the user kind of a verification email
   which the user will click on and they can actually signup. But here we are assuming that the user will send in an
   actual correct email
  - The authenticator applications does this pretty well which is another way to verify users for signup and signin.
  - `Bearer` tells us what type of token, there are various types of tokens that can be used for authenticating
   requests. Api key is another popular option then the api_key will be there instead of the bearer.

- We should hash passwords before storing them in the database, since if we don't then storing passwords directly in the
  database will create a huge security flaw which we don't want. So a good practice is to use hashing libraries which
  stores the converted hash of the password in the database
  - Important concept "salt":
  - Why we should do this because it is one way and now people who maintain the database can never login to our
   account, people repeating passwords is another reason why we should hash passwords
  - But it will still cause security flaws if the password is the same for two different persons since the hashes will
   be the same. So there is this concept of "salt" which adds like a random string or anything with the combination
   of the password and then generates a hash which will always be unique to everyone in the world and so in that way
   it'll be more secure.
  - So the authentication happens in this manner. First signup generates a token (for the user's browser to login
   anytime) and hash (for the database storage), token works as long as the cookie remains i.e signin works and the
   hash will be generated for the person everytime it needs to signup and the same hash will generated for the same
   user

- explanation of the code below

     ```js
    const updatedBody = zod.object({
        firstName: zod.string().optional(),
        lastName: zod.string().optional(),
        password: zod.string().optional(),
    })

    const {success} = updatedBody.safeParse(req.body);
    try {
        if (!success) {
            res.status(411).json({
                message: "Error while updating information"
            })
        }
        await User.updateOne({_id: req.userId}, req, body)
        next();
    }
    ```

  - we can do the updatedBody like that where we take in the zod object with all the schema defined in there and
   then that will auto get the main values from the success destructured object and that updatedBody will take in the

1. **Request Body Parsing and Validation**:

- The `safeParse` method of the `updatedBody` schema is invoked with `req.body` as its argument. This method
   parses and validates the request body against the defined schema.
- The `safeParse` method returns an object containing two properties: `success` and `data`.
- The `success` property is a boolean indicating whether the parsing and validation were successful. If
   successful, `success` is `true`; otherwise, it's `false`.

2. **Destructuring the `success` Object**:

- The `{success}` syntax is a form of destructuring assignment in JavaScript. It extracts the `success` property
   from the object returned by `safeParse`.
- With this destructuring assignment, we directly access the `success` property without having to reference the
   entire object (`{success: boolean}`).

3. **Error Handling based on Success Flag**:

- If `success` is `false`, it means that the parsing and validation failed. In this case, the server responds with
   an error status (411) and an error message.
- If `success` is `true`, it indicates that the parsing and validation were successful, and the request body
   conforms to the expected schema.

4. **Updating User Information**:

- If the parsing and validation are successful (`success === true`), the server proceeds to update the user
   information in the database.
- The `updateOne` method of the `User` model is used to update the user document based on the provided `_id`. The
   update data is taken from the request body (`req.body`).
- There seems to be a typo in the code where `req, body` is written instead of `req.body`. It should be `req.body`.

- **Searching** part: We have done the object key like queries where we put the full name and it searches the name
  but now we'll just type the first three letters and it'll check if the person exists in the DB or not. This is a
  very common usecase in SQL databases where there is `SELECT * FROM USERS WHERE name LIKE "%har"`, that lets us do
  search based on the name looking something like this 'har', but it's not common in mongoDB. So even if a substring
  matches, then it should return that name of users from the DB.
  We can do that by the following way, where we'll use the `$or` which means that the user can enter either the
  firstName and lastName and the regex will get the input,
  so if
  the input is something like 'har' and if the firstName or the lastName consists of that string then that will be
  returned

  ```js
    const users = await User.find({
    $or: [{
    firstName: {
    "$regex": filter
    }
    }, {
    lastName: {
    "$regex": filter
    }
    }]
    }) 
   ```

- The payments part:
  - **Storing balances of users** in a new DB: Up until now we were storing only users in the DB, but now we'll need
   to add the userId as well as the balanaces of the respective user in the DB as well and for that we'll need a new
   model as well as schema, which is as follows. NOTE: The balances should not be kept in a floating point number in
   any sort of DBs, we keep them without the decimal point and we just keep tabs of the number where the decimal
   point will start like for RS 88.88 we'll just store 8888 but we'll make the code like that that it knows that the
   decimal point starts after the 2nd integer.
  - In the real world, you shouldnâ€™t store `floats` for balances in the database.
   You usually store an integer which represents the INR value with
   decimal places (for eg, if someone has 33.33 rs in their account,
   you store 3333 in the database). There is a certain precision that you need to support (which for india is 2/4
   decimal
   places) and this allows you to get rid of precision errors by storing integers in your DB
  - Another thing to keep in mind when creating payment type applications is that we neeed to create references
   which basically means that if the userId in the balances table will always depend on the Users table then we
   need to create 'references' in the DB(similar to foreign keys in SQL) since the user can only create balance
   if the individual is singed in. And it says that this User depends on the Balances table

  ```js
   {
     userId: ObjectId(or string),
     balance: float / number,
   }
  ```

- Now we'll use the ObjectId provided by mongoDB to find the user and reference it from one table to another, so we are creating a new schema and there we are using the `mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId` and we are referencing the User table to find that for us and storing that in the `userId`. Now it ensures that it'll not enter anything who doesn't have a corresponding user in the DB, and only if a certain user with a certain id will be able to enter data in the DB.

  ```js
  const accountScheme = new mongoose.Schema({
    userId: {
      type: mongoose.Schema.Types.ObjectId,
      ref: 'User',
      required: true,
    },
    balance: {
      type: Number,
      required: true,
    },
  })
  ```

- some small things to note:
  - The presence of the `|| ""` after the filter query, the reason is that if the user doesn't pass anything in the search bar then it'll give the empty string as the filter to the regex and that will show us every user that is present in the DB(since it means every user).
  -

- Main transactions in DBs part:
  - Firstly we'll need to make a unified server that will have the users accounts with their respective balances and the paytm wallet balance and not the bank account with the total of the users' balances or even more. Now when there is a transaction like sending money from one user to another, then the sender's money shall be deducted by say 100 and the receivers money will be increased by 100. The problems that may arise here will be something like the money being sent and increased in the receiver's account but not decreased in the sender's and the main paytm server might not have that much money so the bank servers must be very careful of these kind of stuff and these should never happen. So if that happens the whole thing should be reverted by making the balance as it were before the transaction. Either complete all the database calls and transactions or roll back them to their previous state, it must not be in a hung state in the middle
  - Now firstly we'll be creating a check here to see that only using the following code:
    - But this code has some problems
    1. What if the user has 0 balance in the account
    2. What if first problem has been tackled using an if statement and still if there is two requests coming almost instantly, then the if check may fail. In such cases we'll need to create a check which checks for only one request at a time
    3. And what if the server dies after the first requests happens of deducting the amount. In such cases we'll need to put a bunch of checks before that happens so that there is no unwanted problems anywhere.

  ```js
  const mongoose = require('mongoose');
  const Account = require('./path-to-your-account-model');

  const transferFunds = async (fromAccountId, toAccountId, amount) => {
      // Decrement the balance of the fromAccount
      await Account.findByIdAndUpdate(fromAccountId, { $inc: { balance: -amount } });

      // Increment the balance of the toAccount
      await Account.findByIdAndUpdate(toAccountId, { $inc: { balance: amount } });
  }

  // Example usage
  transferFunds('fromAccountID', 'toAccountID', 100);
  ```

  - How the above code works is in the following way:
    - Firstly we have the transferFunds which is an async function that takes in a from and to account id and the amount which will be transacted.
    - Then it will deduct the balance from the sender and increase the balance in the receiver.
    - During these process there may be a bunch of problems that may occur like the database going down which it does from time to time or the server may crash or becomes down from time to time; Also there is no check if the user has 0 balance or not which may make it negative which we don't want obviously. We want both of the process to happen together or neither happens for which we can do 'transactions' in databases which is a very common thing in sql databases but not in nosql databases like mongodb.

  - Bad solution which doesn't transactions and it assumes that the node.js process and the DB will be up all the time which is a very bad assumption.

  ```js
    router.post("/transfer", authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
      const { amount, to } = req.body;

      const account = await Account.findOne({
          userId: req.userId
      });

      if (account.balance < amount) {
          return res.status(400).json({
              message: "Insufficient balance"
          })
      }

      const toAccount = await Account.findOne({
          userId: to
      });

      if (!toAccount) {
          return res.status(400).json({
              message: "Invalid account"
          })
      }

      await Account.updateOne({
          userId: req.userId
      }, {
          $inc: {
              balance: -amount
          }
      })

      await Account.updateOne({
          userId: to
      }, {
          $inc: {
              balance: amount
          }
      })

      res.json({
          message: "Transfer successful"
      })
    });
  ```  

  - Better solution using 'sessions' as well as transactions in mongoDB. How does this work
    - We first have to create a thing called 'session' using the syntax `const session = await mongoose.startSession();` which is a mongoDB thing(maybe) to which we can say that let me do a bunch of stuff in the middle of the session and if any ne of them fails then revert to the previous state.
    - Then we need to start the transaction `session.startTransaction();` using this and then it'll be like everything that happens after this point till `await session.commitTransaction();` either needs to happen together or none will happen, this is how databases are, so if we start a transaction in database it'll not execute it unless we commit it and if we commit it'll execute everything. It'll never partially execute anything that comes between.
    - Also if two concurrent requests come, then they'll not be able to fool the balance checks. So by using a transaction mongoDB will ensure that during that trransaction whatever we have read doesn't get updated during the transaction, eg: if we have read the details of the acccount and that got updated while the transaction was running and someone else updated it then the transaction will fail.
    - By the mongoDB docs, when we are using sessions it makes only one thread run

  ```js
  router.post("/transfer", authMiddleware, async (req, res) => {
    const session = await mongoose.startSession();

    session.startTransaction();
    const { amount, to } = req.body;

    // Fetch the accounts within the transaction
    const account = await Account.findOne({ userId: req.userId }).session(session);

    if (!account || account.balance < amount) {
        await session.abortTransaction();
        return res.status(400).json({
            message: "Insufficient balance"
        });
    }

    const toAccount = await Account.findOne({ userId: to }).session(session);

    if (!toAccount) {
        await session.abortTransaction();
        return res.status(400).json({
            message: "Invalid account"
        });
    }

    // Perform the transfer
    await Account.updateOne({ userId: req.userId }, { $inc: { balance: -amount } }).session(session);
    await Account.updateOne({ userId: to }, { $inc: { balance: amount } }).session(session);

    // Commit the transaction
    await session.commitTransaction();
    res.json({
        message: "Transfer successful"
    });
    });
  ```

- possible errors like these
  -"TypeError: Router.use() requires a middleware function but got a Object" :  While using express routing, it requires you to export the module router in the file to which you are routing to.
  - "ValidationError: User validation failed: userId: Path `userId` is required." : I was setting up an _id as the data in the model of the mongoDB, but that one is already generated by the DB itself so removing that automatically fixed everything.


### about sessions by chatgpt 

`await Account.updateOne({ userId: req.userId }, { $inc: { balance: -amount } }).session(session);`

The line of code you provided updates a document in the `Account` collection in a MongoDB database using Mongoose. Here's what it does:

- `await`: This keyword is used to make the asynchronous operation wait until the update operation is completed before moving on to the next line of code.

- `Account.updateOne`: This is a method provided by Mongoose for updating a single document in the collection based on the specified filter criteria.

- `{ userId: req.userId }`: This is the filter criteria used to identify the document to be updated. It specifies that the document with the `userId` matching the value of `req.userId` should be updated.

- `{ $inc: { balance: -amount } }`: This is the update operation to be performed on the matched document. It uses the `$inc` operator to increment (or decrement) the value of the `balance` field by the specified amount. In this case, it decrements the `balance` by the value of `amount`.

- `.session(session)`: This part of the code indicates that the update operation is part of a MongoDB session. Sessions in MongoDB allow you to group multiple operations together to ensure they are all executed within the same transactional context. By passing the `session` object to the `session()` method, you ensure that this update operation is performed within the specified session, allowing it to be part of a larger transaction.

In summary, the line of code updates the `balance` field of a document in the `Account` collection by decrementing it by the specified amount, and it ensures that this operation is executed within the context of the specified MongoDB session.

### how to keep mongodb url in a different file and then connect it with mongoose, so that if i push the code to github my db credential doesn't go to the github

To keep your MongoDB URL in a separate file and prevent it from being pushed to GitHub along with your code, you can
follow these steps:

1. Create a file to store your MongoDB URL. Let's name it `dbConfig.js`:

   ```javascript
   // dbConfig.js
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');

   const DB_URL = 'your_mongodb_url';

   module.exports = DB_URL;
   ```

Replace `'your_mongodb_url'` with your actual MongoDB URL.

2. In your main application file (e.g., `app.js`), require the `dbConfig.js` file and use the exported URL to connect
   with Mongoose:

   ```javascript
   // app.js
   const mongoose = require('mongoose');
   const DB_URL = require('./dbConfig');

   mongoose.connect(DB_URL, { useNewUrlParser: true, useUnifiedTopology: true })
     .then(() => console.log('MongoDB connected'))
     .catch(err => console.error('MongoDB connection error:', err));
   ```

3. Add `dbConfig.js` to your `.gitignore` file to prevent it from being pushed to GitHub:

   ```
   # .gitignore
   dbConfig.js
   ```

By following these steps, your MongoDB URL will be stored in a separate file (`dbConfig.js`), which will not be pushed
to GitHub due to the `.gitignore` configuration. Therefore, your database credentials will remain private.

### second doubt

```js
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    const user = await User.find();
    res.json({
        msg: user,
    });
});
```

why I got a Typeerror on not using await in the find function, does express return a promise on using find

Yes, in Mongoose, the `find()` function returns a Query object, not a promise directly. However, Mongoose provides a way
to execute the query and obtain a promise using `exec()`. Therefore, to use `find()` with `await`, you need to
call `exec()` after `find()`.

Here's how you can fix your code:

```javascript
app.get('/users', async (req, res) => {
    try {
        const users = await User.find().exec();
        res.json({users});
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({error: 'Internal server error'});
    }
});
```

In this code, `await User.find().exec()` will execute the query and return a promise that resolves to the array of
users. If there's an error during the execution, it will be caught in the `catch` block and a 500 status response will
be sent back.

### third doubt

```json
{
  users: [
    {
      _id: new
      ObjectId(
      '65d9ce2160c314dc4802580f'
      ),
      firstName: 'hello',
      lastName: 'byeee',
      __v: 0
    },
    {
      _id: new
      ObjectId(
      '65d9d4bbfb23acd846620b22'
      ),
      firstName: 'bye',
      lastName: 'good',
      __v: 0
    }
  ]
}
// why do we get the above output when we destructure users and use the .exec() and get the following when we don't do it
[
  {
    _id: new
    ObjectId(
    '65d9ce2160c314dc4802580f'
    ),
    firstName: 'hello',
    lastName: 'byeee',
    __v: 0
  },
  {
    _id: new
    ObjectId(
    '65d9d4bbfb23acd846620b22'
    ),
    firstName: 'bye',
    lastName: 'good',
    __v: 0
  }
]
```

When you call `await User.find().exec()`, Mongoose returns a Mongoose Query object. This object has methods
like `exec()` which allows you to execute the query and obtain the result.

By using `.exec()`, you're explicitly telling Mongoose to execute the query and return a promise that resolves to the
array of documents (users in this case). This is why you see an object with a `users` property containing the array of
users.

On the other hand, when you don't use `.exec()`, Mongoose returns a Query object instead of executing the query
immediately. This is why you see the array of documents directly, as the Query object itself contains the results when
you log it.

### fourth doubt

``` js
async function signupMiddleware(req, res, next) {
 const firstName = req.body.firstName;
 const lastName = req.body.lastName;
 const password = req.body.password;
 const userExists = await User.find({
  firstName: req.body.firstName,
  lastName: req.body.lastName,
  password: req.body.password,
 });

 // credential logic
 try {
  if (!userExists) {
   const user = new User({
    firstName: firstName,
    lastName: lastName,
    password: password,
   });
   await user.save();
   next();
  } else {
   res.status(400).json({
    msg: 'User exists or name exists in database, change your credentials',
   });
  }
 } catch (error) {
  res.status(500).json({
   msg: 'server errorrrrrrrrrrrrrr, refressssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh',
  });
 }
}
```

Why am i not able to enter the input to mongodb here, what am I doing wrong. I always get the message that my user
exists but it doesn't

In your `signupMiddleware` function, you're using `await User.find()` to check if the user already exists.
However, `User.find()` returns an array of documents, not a single document. So even if there's no user
found, `userExists` will still be an empty array, which evaluates to truthy in JavaScript.

To fix this, you should use `User.findOne()` instead of `User.find()`. `User.findOne()` returns a single document
or `null` if no document is found. Here's how you can modify your code:

```javascript
async function signupMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    const firstName = req.body.firstName;
    const lastName = req.body.lastName;
    const password = req.body.password;
    const userExists = await User.findOne({
        firstName: req.body.firstName,
        lastName: req.body.lastName,
        password: req.body.password,
    });

    // credential logic
    try {
        if (!userExists) {
            const user = new User({
                firstName: firstName,
                lastName: lastName,
                password: password,
            });
            await user.save();
            next();
        } else {
            res.status(400).json({
                msg: 'User exists or name exists in database, change your credentials',
            });
        }
    } catch (error) {
        res.status(500).json({
            msg: 'server errorrrrrrrrrrrrrr, refressssssssshhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh',
        });
    }
}
```

With this change, `userExists` will be `null` if no user is found, and the condition `if (!userExists)` will work as
expected.

Is this the correct way to do the update stuff in express mongoose

sol:
No, the approach you're using in the `updateMiddleware` function is incorrect for updating a document in MongoDB using
Mongoose. Here are the corrections:

1. Use `findOneAndUpdate` method provided by Mongoose to find and update a document.
2. Make sure to handle the update operation correctly based on whether the user exists or not.

Here's the corrected version of your code:

```javascript
async function updateMiddleware(req, res, next) {
    const userName = req.body.userName;
    const firstName = req.body.firstName;
    const lastName = req.body.lastName;
    const password = req.body.password;

    try {
        // Check if the user exists
        const userExists = await User.findOne({userName: userName});

        if (userExists) {
            // Update the user's information
            await User.findOneAndUpdate(
                {userName: userName},
                {firstName: firstName, lastName: lastName, password: password}
            );
            next();
        } else {
            // User does not exist, return an error
            res.status(400).json({
                msg: 'User does not exist, cannot be updated. Create one first',
            });
        }
    } catch (error) {
        // Handle server error
        res.status(500).json({
            msg: 'Server error, please try again later',
        });
    }
}
```

This code will attempt to find the user by `userName`. If the user exists, it will update the user's information
using `findOneAndUpdate` method. If the user does not exist, it will return an error message.
