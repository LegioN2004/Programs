# HTML

- div = takes up the whole horizontal space in a html doc(known as division.)
- span = takes up only the required space an element.

- padding = padding is the space around the element that is used to give some breathing space
- border = border as the word says is the border around the element, and it stays between the padding and margin
- margin = margin is the space above the border basically outside the div and is used to give some breathing space outside the padding and border part
