# Colors in CSS

- **Colors** - Colors can be added using the property `color` in CSS.
- Colors can be added using three different types
  1. First we can use the directl color name i.e red, blue, green,etc.
  2. We can use rgb values of colors which ranges from 0 to 255. This rgb works like adding a function value.(rgb is most recommended)
  - It works like: rgb = red green blue(full form) and there are three spaces for numbers separated with commas and they take values starting from 0 to 255. So if we put 255 the last value in the first space before the comma and add 0 to the other two then the whole color will be red. Same goes for second space and as the full form suggest the second space will show green and the third will show blue. It is just a way of something remembering the colors maybe idk
  3. Thirdly we can use hex values to add colors, we need to know this since someone will use them and we need to atleast know what it is and how it works. We can use google to find the correct hex color as desired.

- Any property that is related to colors, adding colors in those works in the same manner as shown above. Eg: `background-color`,
