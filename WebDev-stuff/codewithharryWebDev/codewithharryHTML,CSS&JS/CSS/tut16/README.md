# Developer tools tutorial

- We can right click on the mouse on any element, and in the right click menu if we press inspect we'll reach its code in the dev tools of the browser used. We can do modifications which are only changed locally for ourself only and doesn't take effect universally, useful to see small changes that may come handy
- We can click on the 'rectangle with an arrow' icon on the upper left corner the dev tools, and it'll give a cursor that will take us to the code of any element when clicked on that element. Helps us to change the code in realtime to see small changes(obviously it will not take effect universally and will come to the original setup after a reload)
- In chrome developer tools we can click on any element and it will tell us from which file it is coming.
- There is a thing called : "user agent stylesheet" basically known as 'CSS resetsheet' which is Chrome's or any other browser's, own stylesheet which is by default pre defined to style certain elements by a particular way and that styling is known as user agent stylesheet. Maybe it is due to keeping the ui/ux design flexible and dynamic, of browsers relative to the websites visited within it

1. The elements tab contain all the elements of the html from where we are getting the elements.
2. The console tab in the dev tools is used to run javascript(coming soon)
3. The sources tab contains all the files written
4. The network tab contains any network request that may come

- One thing to remember is that we shall use classes and ids by giving meaningful them names instead of random names from a maintainability point of view, as we will ultimately have to maintain the code for a longer period of time and by having these type of classes and ids it will be easier to do so.
