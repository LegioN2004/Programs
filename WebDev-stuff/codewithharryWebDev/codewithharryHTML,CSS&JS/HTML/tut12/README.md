# SEMANTICS

- Semantics means meaning or giving meaning to a word
- Earlier websites were made only by using div tags and different ids and classes were added, and they were just ordered to make them either footer or header,etc. And so there were no proper way to tell the search engine whether this elemennt with this id or class is a header or footer.
  - But by using the semantic tags, users can understand which are the actual tags header or footer, article, section, etc also in the preview shown in the websites when you link or forward them.
- It is not mandatory to use the semantic tags, but by using the semantic tags the websites will rank better, i.e the SEO will increase.
- some examples are as follows : `<article>`, `<figcaption>`, `<nav>`, `<figure>`, `<footer>`.
- There are also non-semantic elements and some examples are as follows: `<div>`, `<span>`
- Another example of semantics for drop down menu like stuff
  - The `<details>` HTML element creates a disclosure widget in which information is visible only when the widget is toggled into an "open" state (it remains closed by default can be added attributes to changes this). A summary or label must be provided using the `<summary>` element.
