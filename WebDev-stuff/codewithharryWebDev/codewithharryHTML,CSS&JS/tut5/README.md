# Headings and Paragraphs
 ## headings
   - heading should be used only as heading  and only when needed
   - There should be only 1 h1 tag in the html document or it'll deteriorate the seo opitimization
   - Also don't use the h1 tag to make the heading bold, very very wrong

 ## some other tags
   - `<strong></strong>` tag is used to bold a line (can use `<b></b>` but not recommended after HTML5)
   - `<em></em>` (**emphasis**) tag is the which is used to show emphasis to a line or a word. It by default auto turns it into a italic (can use `<i></i>` but not recommended after HTML5)
   - _You should use strong for bold and em for italic._
   - _but we can change both the above else using css_
   - HTML ignores line breaks by default but you can use `<br></br>` tag to  add line breaks bad practice
   - `<hr>` is a horizontal rule, it creates a hori line and it is also a self closing tag
