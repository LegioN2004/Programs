# HTML entities

- What are HTML entities?

  - To write the reserved stuff of HTML(already used such as elements, tags,etc) HTML entities are used, since writing them directly is considered as part of the HTML doc and rendered as HTML.
  - Also the HTML entities can be used to write stuff in HTML doc that is not present on the keyboard such as special characters, etc.
  - usecases of html entities as some examples
    - html by default removes all the spaces between words and only gives 1 space. So to additional spaces between words or other stuff html entities are used
    - one such entity is `&nbsp;` ( knowns as non breaking space), it  gives one space more and can be used many times to give as much spaces as desired . It looks very bad and shouldn't be used in html. We will do styling with CSS  using width and padding,etc.

  - By Default html doesn't show tags inside of other already written tags. To show tags in use `&lt;_tagname_&gt;`
  - Write special characters also using `&_name_;`, here name suggest the one you are looking for emmet has a lot of them, also some are shown directly in the index.html file. 
  - **Use Google for better reference to these special symbols when required**
