<li>First java program input/output debugging and datatypes
<strong> structure of a java file
</strong><em> every file that ends with an extensions .java is a class itself; eg: main.java
</em><strong> since it's name is main.java(or something before .java) it should contain a class with that name (as in before the extension) in the file itself
</strong><em> all the code that we'll be writing will be in this class main/name
</em><strong> remember if a variable name starts with a capital letter then it is a class name (by convention)
</strong><em> if the class with the name of the file is in the file then that will be a class of the public type , in this case main is the public class type
</em><strong><em> public class means that this class will be accessible by all other files , classes, etc
</em></strong> like cpp , java also has a main function (by convention) from where the program starts
<strong><em>* function is a block/collection of code which can be used again and again
</em></strong> you can run with javac <em>name</em>.java and then java <em>name</em> (where name is the class as well as the file name) , also while running the executable with java you can use the name only to run
** explanation of the main.java file
&lt;s public class main { // inside this block of {} is the int main of java as found in cpp
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world!!");
    }
}<blockquote>
<p>*** here class is name group of properties and functions , in the above eg's class we have this function 
    &lt;s public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("hello world!!");
    }</p>
<p><strong><em> all the functions that are in the classes are knows as methods
</em></strong> also the function name has to be main only <s public static void main(String[] args) > it is reserved to be here if it is not main it will not run
<strong><em> here public means the same as the class name <s public static void main(String[] args) > " does it not make sense to make it available to be executed from anywhere
</em></strong> here static means</p>
