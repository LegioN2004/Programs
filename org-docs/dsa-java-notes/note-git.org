#+TITLE: Complete git and github


** always use the name of the branch if you have multiple branches and you are creating files and pushing stuff and commits to a certain branch
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** upstream is the main repo from which the repo is forked for mods in my own account
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
** syncing the forked repo's main with the upstream url repo's main if the forked repo's main branch is a few commits behind the upstream main due to merged commits from the forked repo's other branch

*** git fetch --all --prune
    --all 'here pulls all the branches , commits and other stuff created'
    --prune 'here includes (fetches) the deleted stuff which --all doesn't pull maybe'

*** git reset --hard upstream/main
		this resets the origin/main branch of the forked repo with the upstream/main branch of the main repo so as to sync the repo fully 
**** then push in the origin/main branch in the local system or 
**** to reduce the 2 commands above you can use
		git pull upstream main

*** upstream here pulls from the upstream url and main means from the main branch of the upstream url
**** then you can push the changes to the origin/main branch so as to make the forked repo's main branch in sync with the upstream branch's main

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

*** if you want to merge all the commits in one commit without doing a reset and then try git adding all the files aaaaaaand then commiting
**** then use the 'git rebase -i _file_' ( -i means interactive type i.e in nvim vim type and in the underline use the hash of the commit messaeg from the git log )
**** you will get option pick and squash written in the front of the half hash of the file with the file names 
**** pick means taking the commit and squash/s means that it'll merge its commit( i.e the file where it is written as s ) from the bottom till the top until the first pick comes
