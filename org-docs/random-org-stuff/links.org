- This neorg is the meta neovim version of org with better support, still evolving, planning to use as i am a full time neovim user  and it looks promising but doesn't support in git hosting sites, better for self notes, time table etc stuff. Wanna contribute or have a look, go to [[https://github.com/nvim-neorg/neorg][nvim-neorg/neorg] ::target new]
