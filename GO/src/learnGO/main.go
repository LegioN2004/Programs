package main // first line needs to have a package name, atleast to be executable it should have the main package

// to import different packages for adding different functionality, similar to #include in cpp and imports in java, js and py
// most common one for using input output functionlity
import (
	"fmt"
)

// using functions, done by using the func keyword followed by the name of the function
func main() { // the main function, the first one to declare important in any program, doesn't take any arguments and doesn't return anything
	fmt.Println("heyyyyyy")
}
